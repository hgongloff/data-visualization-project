I familarized myself with the documentation 

I set up the simulator and got the watch whitelisted with my laptop

I was able to deploy a few test apps directly to the watch and have gotten them running succesfully on the watch

I found Documentation for the sensor data and have tested the Heart Rate and Accelerometer data so far. There appears to be some for GPS postition as well as Temperature, Pulse
Oximetry, Speed, Magnetometer, Cadence, Altitude, Oxygen Saturation, and Heading but I havent tested these yet

I have setup the watch for BLE connection but have not been able to test it since I have been having trouble setting up the Pi.

I was able to follow the tutorial Adrian provided for the watch but the pi has been giving me a lot of trouble
