//Web App outline code

//Created as html webpage in visual studio execute by ctrl+ shift + w

//Need to figure out how to separate the text at the <body> so that there is space and the <h1> is at the top of the page (done as can be)
//Font size adjustments were made inline, spacing adjustments were made using padding inline.
//can use the style keyword inline to make adjustments to the spacing or use the CSS page to make adjustments
//Initial formatting for images applied with align keyword, will need some padding and more formatting and needs links to the png images sent by the sponsor in the src 
//spots, alt is for text for the images.

//we dont really need the css since we are doing in line adjustments(can get rid of for the main design site not the additions made in backend)

//FULL FILEPATH works need to figure out how to do this built in folder NEED HELP ON THIS. (fixed by hunter)

//Full filepath from your pc works , but we need to figure out how to integrate a folder of these images onto the website. (fixed by hunter)

//4 values for padding first:top, second:right, third:bottom, fourth:left
//we are using pixels instead of em, pixels are smaller and we can make smaller changes
